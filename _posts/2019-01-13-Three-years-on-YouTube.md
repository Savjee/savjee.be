title: Three years on YouTube

It's been three years since I started my YouTube channel, Simply Explained. In previous years ([2017]({% post_url 2017-01-13-my-first-year-on-youtube %}), [2018]({% post_url 2018-01-08-My-second-year-on-YouTube %})) I wrote blog posts where I reflected on what I did right, wrong and what I would improve. This year is no exception, so here we go!

## Goals for 2018
My goals for 2018 were the following:

* Update the design of this website & redesign the video section.
* Make more Simply Explained videos and record myself more often instead of only showing animations.
* Increase the quality of the video (both audio and video).

Did I achieve these goals? Well, sort of... Let's start with the bad: I didn't give this website any love. It hasn't received a redesign and I didn't improve the video section. It's pretty much the same website as in 2017, just with more content. I have been working sporadically on a new design for it, but haven't finished it because I'm not really convinced that it's better. So maybe I should take 2019 to gradually introduce new elements in the current design, instead of wanting to go for a complete redesign.

As for my YouTube channel: I did focus heavily on Simply Explained videos and even renamed my channel from "Savjee" to "Simply Explained - Savjee". For 2019 I'm thinking of dropping the "Savjee" part altogether. Thoughts?

## Stats for 2018
For those who love numbers, here is an overview of 2018 and how it compared to 2017:

* Third year on YouTube
* 17 new videos uploaded (down from 30 last year)
* 5,177,555 views (up from 1,166,592)
* 19,666,495 total watched minutes (up from 4,113,598)
* 95,205 subscribers gained (up from 19,004)
* 3:47 average time watched (up from 3:31)

All of these metrics have increased and I couldn't be happier. I'd like to focus a lot on the total watch time and the average time watched because those metrics show that people are really watching a large portion of my videos.

## 100,000 subscribers
In 2018 I also surpassed the 100,000 subscriber mark. When I started my channel 3 years ago, this seemed like an impossibly large number to reach. But I didn't give up. I created more videos, increased my quality and worked on my skills as a content producer. And above all: I was patient.

A few weeks after reaching this milestone, YouTube sent me the Silver Play Button and it's been hanging proudly in my office. I hope that one day I can extend the collection with a gold button as well. But until then I have to keep working hard and keep my head down. It must be earned!

The majority of all new subscribers came in because of my "[How does a blockchain work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)" video. That video has gotten a lot of attention (both good and bad) and has propelled my channel to new heights. 

At first, I took this as a sign that I should make more blockchain/cryptocurrency videos. But that gets boring after a while. So instead of listing to the analytics, I decided to instead make videos about any subject I'd like. That way, the work I put into my YouTube channel remains fun, challenging and not boring.

## Goals for 2019
For 2019, the plan is to keep doing what I'm doing right now. Only better ;)

First of all, I want to keep investing my time in making Simply Explained videos. I'm a curious person and I'm always reading articles and random Wikipedia pages. Being able to take that knowledge, repackage it and make a video about it, is really cool to do!

Secondly, I want to keep working on quality. In 2018 I made a few videos where I record myself talking about a subject and then placing my head on top of some animations. This all sounds easy to do with a green screen, but I didn't have one! This year I'd like to continue to make such videos but with a real green screen, so the quality will be better and it'll be a lot less of a hassle.

And lastly, I want to distance myself a bit from blockchain and cryptocurrency related videos. I do love learning more about these technologies, but I also want to make it clear that Simply Explained is about more than that. For instance: I've been making a few cool IoT devices in my spare time and I'm thinking about showing them off in a series of videos.

## Thanks!
Before ending this post I want to thank everyone who watched one of my videos and/or subscribed to my channel. You rock! I wish you all a great 2019 & don't forget: keep learning!
