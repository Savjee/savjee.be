In this video I'll show you how to create a front-end for your Lambda functions. I'm going to build a HTML front-end for the guestbook functions that I showed you in the previous 2 video's.

The static front-end that I create in this video is written in HTML and Javascript and can be hosted anywhere you'd like. I've chosen to host it on Amazon S3 for scalability reasons.
