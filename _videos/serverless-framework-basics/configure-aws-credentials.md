Learn how to create AWS credentials and then use them with the Serverless framework. This is the final step before we can start deploying functions to AWS Lambda!

**Note:** The framework recommends that you give it "Administrator" permissions. This is only because they're rapidly adding more features and it's hard to lock them down. Keep good care of the credentials that you generate because they'll be able to access all your AWS resources.
