Blockchains are hard to understand, so let's visualize their inner workings by building a front-end application in Angular. I'll show you how to visualize blocks on the chain and the transactions inside them. We'll also make a UI to create new transactions and to mine new blocks.

A [live demo of the front-end is available here](https://savjee.github.io/savjeecoin-frontend/).
