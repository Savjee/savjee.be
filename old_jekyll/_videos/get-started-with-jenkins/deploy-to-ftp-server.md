In this video I'll show you how you can use Jenkins to automatically deploy your code to a FTP server. You could use this to automatically upload your website to your hosting provider, each time you make a commit.

I will be using git-ftp to upload files from a git repository to a FTP server. This piece of software will only upload changed files to your server, so it's very efficient. It will also remove any deleted files from your server.

# BitBucket Pipelines
Don't want to use Jenkins? You can also use BitBucket Pipelines to upload files to a FTP server. [Check out my blog post here]({% post_url 2016-06-01-Deploying-website-to-ftp-or-amazon-s3-with-BitBucket-Pipelines %}).
