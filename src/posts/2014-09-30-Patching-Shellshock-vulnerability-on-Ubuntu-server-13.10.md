title: Patching Shellshock vulnerability on Ubuntu Server 13.10

On September 24, 2014 a Bash vulnerability was discovered that could lead to arbitrary code execution. The bash shell is used in many operating systems, including Linux, BSD and Mac OS X.

After some testing I found out that [my RamNode VPS]({% post_url 2014-04-28-Running-OpenVPN-on-a-cheap-RamNode-VPS %}) (running Ubuntu Server 13.10) is vulnerable to the exploit. Sadly, this release of Ubuntu Server is unsupported and doesn't receive Bash updates!

Fortunately there is a way to manually update Bash and patch the vulnerability. In this post I'll show you how to check if your vulnerable and how to fix it.

# Am I vulnerable?
There are currently 4 known exploits. You can test if you're vulnerable for each one by running the commands, or you can [skip to the fix](#thefix).

* [Exploit 1](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271)
<pre>``env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"``</pre>
If you see "vulnerable" you are at risk.

* [Exploit 2](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7169)
<pre>``env X='() { (shellshocker.net)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat echo; rm ./echo``</pre>
If you see the current date, you are at risk.

* [Exploit 3](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186)
<pre>``bash -c 'true <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF' || echo "CVE-2014-7186 vulnerable, redir_stack"``</pre>
You are at risk if your system echo's the text: "``CVE-2014-7186 vulnerable, redir_stack``"

* [Exploit 4](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7187)
<pre>``(for x in {1..200} ; do echo "for x$x in ; do :"; done; for x in {1..200} ; do echo done ; done) | bash ||
echo "CVE-2014-7187 vulnerable, word_lineno"``</pre>
If your systems outputs "``CVE-2014-7187 vulnerable, word_lineno``" you are at risk.

# <a name="thefix"></a> The fix (Ubuntu 13.10)
In order to patch Ubuntu Server 13.10 you'll need to manually download and install a new Bash package.

* Start by looking for the most recent version of Bash on the [Debian Packages website](https://packages.debian.org/sid/bash).

* Look for the package for your architecture. My VPS is a 32-bit machine so I downloaded the ``i386`` package. For a 64-bit machine you'll need the ``amd64`` package.

* Download the package to your server using the ``wget`` command:
<pre>``wget [URL_of_package]``</pre>

* Install the new version of bash: 
<pre>``sudo dpkg -i bash_4.3-9.2_i386.deb``</pre>

This should fix exploit 1, 2 and 4 but not exploit 3.

# Not a full patch yet
Keep in mind that the new version doesn't patch Shellshock entirely. Keep an eye on [the package page of Bash](https://packages.debian.org/sid/bash) for new versions. I'll also update this post is extra steps are required in the future.
