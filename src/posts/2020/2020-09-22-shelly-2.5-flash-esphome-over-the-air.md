It's no secret that I'm a fan of Shelly products to automate various devices in my house. They're well built, tiny and rock solid, and best of all: compatible with ESPHome.

I flashed ESPHome onto all my Shelly 1's, but for some reason, I have issues with my Shelly 2.5 devices... Here's how I flashed ESPHome onto them over-the-air. No wires!

## My problems with the Shelly 2.5
Shelly devices usually have exposed programming pins that you can use to attach a USB-to-UART adapter (through the TX and RX pins). That's how I flashed my Shelly 1 units. However, the Shelly 2.5 is problematic.

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/shelly-25-pinout.png)

First up: the pins are smaller than regular Dupont pins (the ones you find on practically every micro-controller board). That means you have to use [special adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shelly-2-5-Adapter-Cable-25/dp/B07TS2KPW7) (which is outrageously expensive) or a [stripped ethernet cable](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/5652#issuecomment-534008987) or [female-to-female jumper wires](https://www.die-welt.net/2020/05/building-a-shelly-25-usb-to-ttl-adapter-cable/).

These options are ugly and impractical. I tried using needles, which fit the holes, but I couldn't get the Shelly into download mode.

I gave up on it and used the default firmware instead. Then, weeks later, I found a workaround to flash them over-the-air. No need for me to take my Shelly's out the wall again. Cool!

## Overview
Here's what we'll do:

* Create an ESPHome configuration for the Shelly 2.5 and compile a firmware
* Use a special firmware to update the Shelly to Tasmota over-the-air
* Use Tasmota to flash the ESPHome firmware

Let's get going!

## Creating an ESPHome configuration
I'll start by creating an ESPHome configuration for the Shelly 2.5. As usual, there's already one available on [esphome-configs.io](https://esphome-configs.io/devices/shelly-25/). I'm using the second one which includes protection against drawing too much current & over-temperature.

Here's my configuration (slightly adapted to expose 2 lights to Home Assistant):

```yaml
substitutions:
  devicename: shelly_25_bathroom
  # Name for the relays
  channel_1: Light 1
  channel_2: Light 2

      filters:
        - multiply: -1
      on_value_range:
        - above: ${max_power}
          then:
            - switch.turn_off: shelly_relay_1
            - homeassistant.service:
                service: persistent_notification.create
                data:
                  title: Message from ${devicename}
                data_template:
                  message: Switch turned off because power exceeded ${max_power}W
    update_interval: 30s

        - light.toggle: lightid1
  - platform: gpio
    pin:
      number: GPIO5
    name: "${channel_2} input"
    internal: true
    on_state:
      then:
        - light.toggle: lightid2
```

I found that the maximum temperature of 70°C is a bit low. My units reach that temperature quickly with a relatively small load (about 30-50W), so I increased the limit to 80°C.

I'm using the ESPHome add-on for Home Assistant. To compile the firmware, head over to your configuration, click the 3 dots and click "Compile".

After compilation, click "Download binary" to get the `.bin` file:

## Flash intermediate firmware
Next up: flashing Tasmota onto the Shelly over-the-air.

I'm using an open-source tool called [mg2x](https://github.com/yaourdt/mgos-to-tasmota)  which converts the Shelly from running [Mongoose OS](https://mongoose-os.com) to Tasmota. It supports the following models:

* Shelly 1 
* Shelly 1PM
* Shelly Plug S
* Shelly 2
* Shelly 2.5
* Shelly RGBW2
* Shelly EM

Start by finding the IP address of your Shelly device. I did this through my router, but you can also use the Shelly's native firmware.

Once you have that, navigate to this URL:

```
http://SHELLY_IP_ADDRESS/ota?url=http://dl.dasker.eu/firmware/mg2tasmota-Shelly25.zip
```

**Pay attention**: the URL depends on your Shelly device. The above is valid for the Shelly 2.5. Check the [mg2x README](https://github.com/yaourdt/mgos-to-tasmota) for a list of alternative URLs for other Shelly devices.

You should see the following JSON document as response:

```json
{
  "status": "updating",
  "has_update": false,
  "new_version": "20200812-091015/v1.8.0@8acf41b0",
  "old_version": "20200601-122849/v1.7.0@d7961837"
}
```

The Shelly will now download the intermediate firmware, which in turn will download and flash Tasmota. This took about 2 minutes.

## Configure Tasmota
Next up, we have to configure Tasmota. Make sure your computer is physically near the Shelly and scan for WiFi networks. There should be a `tasmota-XXXXX` network. Connect to it. 

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/tasmota-wifi-network.png)

In my case, macOS showed a popup with Tasmota's captive portal. If this doesn't happen on your computer, navigate to the Shelly 2.5 directly: [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)

Fill in your WiFi network name (SSID) and password. Then, scroll down and click "Save".

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/tasmota-save-config.png)


The Shelly will now attempt to connect to your WiFi network. Make sure you do the same on your computer.

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/tasmota-restart.png)

Browse to the IP address of your Shelly and you should see the default Tasmota page. No point in configuring the module. We're going to ESPHome!

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/tasmota-main-screen.png)

Before we can upload ESPHome, we have to disable Tasmota's firmware check. By default, it only allows you to flash other Tasmota builds (that's a safety feature).

To do that, go to "Console" and type in this command, followed by return:

```
SetOption78 1
```

Tasmota will confirm the change:

Now we can flash our ESPHome firmware.

Go back to the main screen and click on "Firmware Upgrade". Upload your ESPHome firmware and click "Start upgrade".

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/tasmota-firmware-upgrade-esphome.png)

ESPHome is now being flashed. This process takes about a minute.

After a short wait, head over to your Home Assistant installation and check your notifications. My device was automatically discovered:

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/home-assistant-discovered-devices.png)

Click "Configure" and follow the onboarding process of Home Assistant. Easy!

![](/uploads/2020-09-shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/home-assistant-esphome-configure.png)

All the necessary entities should now have been created in Home Assistant. Here are my living room lights as an example:

## Problem: no energy monitoring
As you can see from the screenshot above, the energy monitoring doesn't work, even though the [ADE7953 power sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/ade7953.html), is correctly configured.

In the logs I could see that ESPHome detected no i2c devices, and even threw `NACK` errors when trying to talk to the sensor:

```
[15:35:58][C][i2c:028]: I2C Bus:
[15:35:58][C][i2c:029]:   SDA Pin: GPIO12

[15:35:58][I][i2c:033]: Scanning i2c bus for active devices...
[15:35:58][I][i2c:049]: Found no i2c devices!

[15:40:39][W][i2c:070]: Received NACK on transmit of address 0x38
[15:40:39][W][i2c:070]: Received NACK on transmit of address 0x38
[15:40:39][W][i2c:070]: Received NACK on transmit of address 0x38
[15:40:39][W][i2c:070]: Received NACK on transmit of address 0x38
[15:40:39][W][i2c:070]: Received NACK on transmit of address 0x38
```

I tried power-cycling the Shelly with the [Restart Switch in ESPHome](https://esphome.io/components/switch/restart.html?highlight=restart), to no avail. I then submitted a [bug report on GitHub](https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/1497).

It seems like the power sensor is going in a sleep mode and can't be woken up.

Ultimately, someone suggested to properly power-cycle the Shelly. I installed mine behind a light switch and I didn't want to open that up again. So instead, I toggled my circuit breaker off and on:

Sure enough, the Shelly now reports the correct power stats for each relay, along with the voltage it receives.

I hope you found this tutorial helpful. Let me know in the comments if you run into issues or you have suggestions.
