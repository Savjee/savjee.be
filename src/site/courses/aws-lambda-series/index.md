In this video I'll give you an overview of this series: getting started with Lambda.

In the series I'll cover topics like creating a function in Node.js, deploying them with automated tools, executing functions with HTTP calls, integrating them with other AWS services and much more!

Lambda allows developers to deploy "serverless" applications. Obviously there are still servers involved, but you don't have to manage them yourself.
