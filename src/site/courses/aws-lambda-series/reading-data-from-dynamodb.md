In this video I'm going to show you how you can use Lambda to read data out of DynamoDB tables. In the previous video I've showed you how to create an online guestbook that writes data to DynamoDB. In this video we'll now write a function that reads back the data from DynamoDB so we can show our guestbook entries.

# Source code
Source code of the Lambda function that reads data from DynamoDB can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SavjeeTutorials/getting-started-with-lambda/tree/master/08-read-from-dynamodb" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
