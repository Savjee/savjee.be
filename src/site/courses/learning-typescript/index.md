Object oriented design patterns help you create more robust and flexible software. In this course I will show you how to use these patterns in TypeScript.

<!--more-->

Design patterns are best practices that will help you solve common problems in programming. There is no need to solve a generic problem that has been solved many times before.

Simple example: how do you write a system that allows user to order a product and customize some of its features? There are many possible solutions but they probably won't be as flexible as using a decorator pattern.


## What you will learn
* Use object oriented design patterns to write better and more flexible software.
  * Decorator pattern
  * Observer pattern
  * Facade pattern
  * Adapter pattern
  * State pattern

## Requirements
* You should have basic knowledge of object oriented programming. Know the basics of classes, interfaces and inheritance.
* Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript (or any other object-oriented language)


This is an introduction video to my "Learning TypeScript" series. In the next videos I will show you how to start using TypeScript. I'll discuss the benefits of TypeScript and how to use it step by step.

TypeScript compiles to regular JavaScript so it can run in any browser or on node.js. There's no reason not to use it!
