Learn how to create your first Serverless project. I'll show you the project structure & main configuration file. Luckily, Serverless can create a boilerplate project for us.

To create a new node.js project for AWS, you should use:

<pre>sls create --template aws-nodejs</pre>

Note that ``sls`` is the same as ``serverless``, it's just a shortcut.
