Object oriented design patterns help you create more robust and flexible software. In this course I will show you how to use these patterns in TypeScript.

Design patterns are best practices that will help you solve common problems in programming. There is no need to solve a generic problem that has been solved many times before.

Simple example: how do you write a system that allows user to order a product and customize some of its features? There are many possible solutions but they probably won't be as flexible as using a decorator pattern.


## What you will learn
* Use object oriented design patterns to write better and more flexible software.
  * Decorator pattern
  * Observer pattern
  * Facade pattern
  * Adapter pattern
  * State pattern

## Requirements
* You should have basic knowledge of object oriented programming. Know the basics of classes, interfaces and inheritance.
* Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript (or any other object-oriented language)
