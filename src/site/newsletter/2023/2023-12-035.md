Hi everyone!

I can't believe this is already the last newsletter of 2023. Time really flies when you're having fun!

Last month I made an  for my son so he can decide what to watch on the TV. He‚Äôs allowed to watch a bit of TV each day, but he depends on us to operate the remote. With this system, he can flip through our ‚Äúmovie library‚Äù, and put a card on the reader to watch. It‚Äôs very similar to what I did with VHS tapes when I was a kid.

To see how it works, check out [this blog post]({% link collections.posts, "2023-11-14-how-i-built-an-nfc-movie-library-for-my-kids" %}).

And with that, I want to wish you and your family happy holidays. Have a great start of the new year. See you in 2024!

Xavier

## ü§ì Cool Stuff I Found on the Internet

### [How animals see the world](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/qgWhAEJda6STRg)
This cool website simulates how different animals see the world. It surprised me to see it was made by Google. The UK Natural History Museum [has a version where you can compare human vision to that of certain animals](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/how-do-other-animals-see-the-world.html). 


### [Zeppelins are back!](https://bigthink.com/the-future/airship-tests-pathfinder1/)
Sergey Brin‚Äôs startup LTA Research will test the Pathfinder-1, a giant airship prototype designed to transport cargo. The ship is full of non-flammable helium and features electric motors and a lightweight design. Initial tests will keep the Pathfinder-1 tethered and low, but plans include flying over San Francisco Bay. Airships offer a cleaner alternative to airplanes and could create a new sustainable aviation industry.



### [Revealed: Google pays Apple $20 billion a year!](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-google-safari-search-revenue/)
During the antitrust lawsuit against Google, details of its deal with Apple have leaked. Google pays 36% of the total revenue it earns from searched conducted on Apple devices. That's estimated to be almost $20 billion per year, or 15% of Apple's annual profits. Microsoft CEO says this deal makes it impossible to compete with Google as few people take the time to change the default search engine. And some say dissolving the deal could be the catalyst for Apple to develop its own search engine.



### [Antibodies as birth control](https://bigthink.com/health/non-hormonal-birth-control-antibodies/)
Birth control for women is often hormone-based and comes with side-effects. A new technique wants to use antibodies that are engineered to stick to sperm cells to immobilize them. Initial tests on sheep suggest the method is 99.9% effective. The technique is not a human invention. Similar antibodies have naturally developed in around 10% of women treated for infertility.

## üëΩ Space

### [Dropped my hammer... In space...](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/10/nasa-tool-bag-dropped-by-astronauts-international-space-station/71536725007/)
While performing maintenance on the International Space Station, an astronaut lost a tool bag. It now orbits Earth at an altitude of 200 miles. That‚Äôs so close you can spot it with a pair of good binoculars! The tool bag, which is now cataloged as space junk, is expected to fall back to Earth and burn up. Space debris is a serious problem, and if left unmanaged could lead to Kessler Syndrome, a scenario where one collision in space will trigger a cascade of collisions.



### [Catapult to space: Slinging satellites into space](https://www.freethink.com/space/spinlaunch-91232)
SpinLaunch wants to revolutionize the space launch industry by using a gigantic centrifuge to hurl payloads into orbit, rather than relying on traditional rockets. By spinning a payload to extreme speeds (8,000 km/h) within an enclosed vacuum, and then releasing it skyward, the company aims to dramatically cut costs and increase launch frequency. However, their system isn't suited for manned missions as the extreme forces would be fatal.

## üè• Health & Medicine

### [CRISPR treatment for high cholesterol](https://www.freethink.com/health/cholesterol-treatment)
There are two types of cholesterol: HDL and LDL. The former seems to be beneficial for us, while the latter will block arteries and lead to heart attacks or strokes. High cholesterol is currently treated with pills or injections, but those have side-effects. Verve Therapeutics wants to use CRISPR to change the DNA in your liver and deactivate a gene that regulates LDL in the blood. A 1 letter DNA change results in a 70% reduction of cholesterol in just 2 weeks, and levels remained low for 2.5 years! It's not an approved treatment, but human trials are underway.



### [How much does the immune system weigh?](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2308511120)
Our immune system is vital for survival, and yet there‚Äôs so much we don‚Äôt know about it. This study has quantified how many cells make up the immune system and how much they weigh. The immune system of an average person comprises 1.8 trillion cells and weighs about 1.2 kg. If you want to learn more about the immune system, check out the book [Immune](https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Journey-Mysterious-System-Keeps/dp/0593241312/). It's written by the creator of the [Kurzgesagt YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt) and has stunning illustrations!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Energy & Environment

### [Stockholm bans internal combustion engines from city center](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/stockholm-ban-petrol-and-diesel-cars-city-centre-2025-swedish-capital-pollution)
Stockholm is taking a bold step to combat air pollution and noise by planning to ban petrol and diesel vehicles from its city center starting in 2025. The initiative will cover 20 blocks, encompassing financial and shopping districts. Unlike systems that charge polluting vehicles, Stockholm will prohibit them outright. Certain exceptions will apply, such as for emergency vehicles and individuals with documented disabilities. Plug-in hybrid vans will also be permitted. With this ambitious project, the city aims to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.



### [A salty battery breakthrough?](https://northvolt.com/articles/northvolt-sodium-ion/)
Northvolt has announced a groundbreaking sodium-ion battery with an energy density of over 160 watt-hours per kilogram. It stands out for its safety, affordability, and use of plentiful materials like sodium and iron, while completely ditching rare metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Its energy density is lower than lithium-ion batteries, but the company is focussing on using this technology for energy storage projects where density is less important.
