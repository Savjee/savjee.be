Hi everyone!

As this is the first edition of 2025, I want to start by wishing you a happy new year. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and are refueled to take on this new year.

Before we get going, I want to mention [an amazing blog post by Adam Singer about "algorithm comfort"](https://www.hottakes.space/p/dont-let-machines-or-the-crowd-decide).

He starts by asking a simple question: when was the last time you browsed around a bookstore and picked a book that *looked* interesting purely by looking at the cover? When did you not buy a book because it was recommended to you or because it had good reviews? Most of us don‚Äôt do this anymore.

Instead, we read books that Amazon recommends us. We listen to songs Spotify recommends. We watch videos that YouTube pushes in our feed.


The troubling part is that these algorithms do one thing: they subtly funnel us into the same streams.


Following algorithms means blending into the mainstream wasteland. You lose your impulse to explore. You‚Äôll have less courage to confront the unfamiliar. And even worse: it will erode your creativity.


So let's break the mold in 2025! Judge a book by its cover and give it a chance. Listen to that weird heavy metal band that incorporates math into their songs.

I hope this newsletter can help you break the algorithmic comfort and discover things you otherwise wouldn't have.

Cheers,
Xavier

## ü§ì Cool Stuff I Found on the Internet

### [4-day work week is a hit](https://euroweeklynews.com/2025/01/12/germanys-four-day-work-week-proves-to-be-a-massive-hit/)
A German study found that a 4-day work week boosts employee productivity and well-being. Companies saw output remain the same or even increase despite a 20% reduction in work time. Could the 100-80-100 model (100% pay, 80% time, 100% output) be the future of work?


### [TikTok "rots" your brain](https://www.psypost.org/does-tiktok-really-cause-brain-rot-new-study-links-short-video-addiction-to-brain-abnormalities/)
A study found that excessive use of short video platforms like TikTok leads to increased brain activity in emotional regulation and reward processing areas. This was linked to disrupted sleep patterns, emotional dysregulation, and impairments in attention and memory.


### [Laptop stand made from a sheet of paper](https://www.core77.com/posts/134948/A-Laptop-Stand-Made-from-a-Single-Sheet-of-Recycled-Paper)
The g.stand is a laptop stand made from a single sheet of recycled paper. Despite weighing only 45g, it can support even heavy laptops.



### [Starlink vs Stealth aircraft](https://cacm.acm.org/news/the-end-of-stealth/)
Stealth planes have special shapes to block radar signals. Chinese researchers claim they can now detect those planes using Starlink satellites as the planes cast a "shadow" against the satellite signals. It's a clever idea, and hard to prevent. 


## ü§® Questions nobody asked

With two young kids at home, I'm always wondering how long it'll take before they catch their next cold.

But I noticed something odd: while our kids are catching one bug after the other, my girlfriend and I remain mostly unaffected. Why? Is the immune system of parents somehow stronger because we're exposed to more germs?

Turns out, the immune system of parents is indeed "stronger". A [study found](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160215114023.htm) that parents are 48% less likely to develop symptoms of a common cold.

That‚Äôs not to say parents are immune to colds. They get infected at similar rates, but they develop fewer symptoms when infected. On par with our experience.

The study also found that having 3 or more children boosts your immune system even further. Oh, and this effect was only observed in parents aged 24-55.


## üß†ü§ñ Artificial intelligence

### [Project Digits: personal supercomputer](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337530/nvidia-ces-digits-super-computer-ai)

### [Lawsuit: Meta pirated data to train AI](https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-says-mark-zuckerberg-approved-metas-use-of-pirated-materials-to-train-llama-ai-141548827.html)
A lawsuit against Meta alleges that the company, with Mark Zuckerberg's approval, knowingly used pirated materials from LibGen to train its Llama AI models. The company allegedly admitted to torrenting LibGen content despite employee concerns. This case is part of a larger copyright infringement lawsuit filed in 2023 against Meta and OpenAI.



### [Chinese reasoning model beating OpenAI?](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/)
DeepSeek has released an open-source version of its reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, claiming performance comparable to OpenAI's models on certain benchmarks. The model, available under an open source license (!), excels in physics, science, and math domains. With 671 billion parameters, R1 offers improved reliability through self-fact-checking. Smaller versions are also available for various hardware capabilities.



### [AI dubbed Zelenskyy interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc)
Lex Fridman interviewed the President of Ukraine on his podcast. They spoke a mixture of languages, but what's interesting is that Fridman enlisted Elevenlabs to dub the interview in English, Russian, and Ukrainian. Not only was the interview dubbed, the voices of Fridman and Zelenskyy were also cloned by AI.

### [AI-powered phishing campaigns](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/human-study-on-ai-spear-phishing-campaigns)
This study used GPT-4 and Claude to automate the entire phishing process - from gathering intel on targets to writing persuasive emails. The researchers achieved click-through rates over 50% and claim this could radically lower costs for attackers. It may even render spam filters obsolete as each phishing mail is uniquely tailored.


### ["Free" AI in office suites](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24343794/google-workspace-ai-features-free)
Google is now offering all AI features "free of charge" to all Workspace users. This move intensifies the competition with Microsoft. While the AI features are now included at no extra cost, Google is slightly increasing the base price of Workspace plans. The new offering includes AI-powered tools for email summaries, design generation, meeting note-taking, and access to the Gemini bot.
