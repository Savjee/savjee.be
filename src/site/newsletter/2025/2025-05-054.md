Hi everyone!

I'm getting married in a little over 2 weeks time, and over the past few weeks, I've been looking for the last piece of my outfit: a nice watch. I went deep into the world of watches. I binged [Teddy Baldassarre](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLGp7H4XuzA9TLJ0L4PUx8w), discovered [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WristwatchRevival) of a dude servicing watches (it's more exciting than it sounds), and bookmarked 28 potential candidates on Chrono24.

Then suddenly, my girlfriend was bombarded with ads for watches on Instagram and Facebook. Wow. How did Meta know to target her with ads for watches? Do they listen to our private conversations disagreements about watches?

Then I remembered [an article I read a while ago](https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/your-phone-isnt-listening-to-you-but-the-truth-is-scarier/42345949.html). The answer is, of course, no. Constantly recording and processing our conversation would require a ton of computing power. The answer is simpler: Meta or Google don‚Äôt have to listen to our private conversations because they already know everything! They‚Äôve got our search history, location, IP address, etc. It‚Äôs not rocket science to connect the dots...

Enjoy this edition of the newsletter!

## ü§ì Cool Stuff I Found on the Internet

### [Crashing Windows with a song](https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-engineer-janet-jackson-song-mysteriously-crash-windows-xp/)
A weird bug in Windows XP caused PCs to crash when playing Janet Jackson‚Äôs ‚ÄúRhythm Nation.‚Äù The song‚Äôs frequencies matched the resonant frequency of certain 5400rpm hard drives, causing hardware damage. Microsoft has to create a custom audio filter to block the problematic frequency and has been present until Windows 7!



### [Scientists Create New Color](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/18/scientists-claim-to-have-found-colour-no-one-has-seen-before)
Want to see a new color? Beam a laser into specific cells of your retina and you will see the color ‚Äúolo‚Äù. It‚Äôs described as an incredibly saturated blue-green. The scientists used a technique called Oz vision to stimulate medium wavelength cones in the retina, creating a visual experience that natural light can not replicate. The team believes this technology could lead to better treatment for vision-related disorders.



### [Sound to ease motion sickness](https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2025/04/20250408-01.html)
Researchers at Nagoya University have discovered a novel approach to reducing motion sickness using sound! By exposing participants to a unique 100 Hz sound for just one minute, they observed a significant reduction in symptoms, such as nausea and dizziness. Potentially a non-invasive and practical solution for millions of people suffering from motion sickness.



### [The Song That Shaped MP3](https://observer.com/2008/09/suzanne-vega-is-the-mother-of-the-mp3/)
Suzanne Vega, best known for her hits ‚ÄúLuka‚Äù and ‚ÄúTom‚Äôs Diner,‚Äù played a role in the development of the MP3 format. German scientist Karl-Heinz Brandenburg used the a cappella version of ‚ÄúTom‚Äôs Diner‚Äù as a test track to perfect the MP3 algorithm. The song‚Äôs simplicity and clarity made it ideal for fine-tuning the compression process.



## ‚è≥ On this day...

[1902](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) - Greek archaeologist Valerios Stais discovers the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient mechanical analog computer. This artifact showcases early technological ingenuity and continues to fascinate scientists and historians.

[1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_6) - Soviet Venera 6 begins its descent into the atmosphere of Venus, sending back atmospheric data before being crushed by pressure.

### [Did we find Planet Nine?](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/astronomers-first-real-clue-to-planet-nine/)
A new study has potentially identified a promising candidate for the long-theorized Planet Nine. Using far-infrared data from IRAS and AKARI all-sky surveys, the team searched for slow-moving objects beyond Neptune. They applied strict criteria to cross-match sources between the two surveys, narrowing down to one strong candidate. We need more observations, but I‚Äôm already super excited. This could be the first new planet discovered in our solar system during my lifetime!



### [Failed Venus lander crashes to Earth after 53 years](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/failed-soviet-venus-lander-kosmos-482-crashes-to-earth-after-53-years-in-orbit)
The Soviet Venus probe Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, has finally reentered Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after 53 years in orbit. The spacecraft, originally intended for Venus, was stranded in Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.

## üè• Health & Medicine

### [Effect of fluoride on dental health](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fluoride-drinking-water-dental-health)
Fluoride is added to tap water to help prevent tooth decay. It strengthens tooth enamel and makes it more resistant to the acids produced by bacteria in the mouth. Some people don‚Äôt believe this, and 2 cities in the US actually stopped adding fluoride. The result? In Calgary, children requiring general anesthesia for tooth decay treatment nearly doubled.


### [Bite me snake one more time](https://www.the-scientist.com/a-man-who-survived-hundreds-of-snakebites-helped-scientists-develop-a-potent-antivenom-72977)
