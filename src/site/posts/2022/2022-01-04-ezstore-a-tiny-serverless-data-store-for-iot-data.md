I've been working on a few IoT projects recently, and while prototyping, I need a simple but flexible data store. I just want to push data to an API and query and visualize it later on.

There are many solutions for this, but most are expensive or very limited. So I set out to build my own serverless IoT data store with 2 Lambda functions and a DynamoDB table.

## Overview
Here's the high-level overview of EZStore's architecture:

## Using EZStore
EZStore has 2 APIs: one to ingest data from IoT devices and one to get it back out. They're exposed through API Gateway as a simple [HTTP API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html).

IoT devices can add new data by posting a JSON document to the `metrics` endpoint:

```
POST /ezstore/v1/metrics/{deviceId}

{
	"temperature": 21.67,
	"humidity": 65.10,
}
```

The `ingest` Lambda function will add this data to DynamoDB and add a timestamp to it. To get it back, make a `GET` request to the same endpoint:

```
GET /ezstore/v1/metrics/{deviceId}

{
    "data": [
        {
            "temperature": 21.67,
            "humidity": 65.10,
            "timestamp": 1641286719828
        }
    ]
}
```

This will return all the data received in the last 7 days. You can also define your own start and end date by providing them as query string parameter:

```
GET /ezstore/v1/metrics/{deviceId}?start_date=2021-08-01&end_date=2021-08-31
```

## DynamoDB table design

Let's now look at how data is stored in DynamoDB. In a nutshell: the device ID is being used as the primary key with the date as sort key. All new data points are then appended to a list:

<table class="pure-table pure-table-bordered pure-table-striped">
    <tr>
        <th>Primary key<br>(deviceId)</th>
        <th>Sort key</th>
        <th>Data</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">1a8b6</td>
        <td>reading-2022-01-03</td>
        <td>
            <pre>
[
  {
    timestamp: 1641232913,
    temperature: 21.8,
    humidity: 64.1
  },
  {
    timestamp: 1641236513,
    temperature: 20.8,
    humidity: 75.8
  }
]
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>reading-2022-01-04</td>
        <td>
            <pre>
[
  {
    timestamp: 1641232913,
    temperature: 21.8,
    humidity: 64.1
  },
  {
    timestamp: 1641236513,
    temperature: 20.8,
    humidity: 75.8
  }
] 
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>my-test-device-1</td>
        <td>reading-2022-01-04</td>
        <td>...</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

This is a very simple table design that can store up to 400KB of data per sensor per day. More than enough for my prototyping needs (usually a few data points every 10-30minutes).

This setup has a few limitations though, but I'll address those later. Let's now look at the brains of the operation: the Lambda functions.

## Lambda functions: the basics
First up, there's a certain amount of code that is being shared between the `ingest` and `api` function. Things like the DynamoDB Document Client, an interface to describe the shape of items in the database and a helper function to construct the sort key:

```tsx
import { DynamoDB } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { DynamoDBDocument } from "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb";

const dynamoClient = new DynamoDB({ region: process.env.region });
export const tableName = process.env.TABLE_NAME ?? "";
export const docClient = DynamoDBDocument.from(dynamoClient);

export interface EZStoreDynamoItemMetric {
    timestamp: number;
    [key: string]: string | number | boolean;
}

export function getDateForSortKey(date: Date){
    return "reading-" + date.toISOString().substring(0, 10);
}
```

## Lambda  #1: ingest
Then we have the `ingest` function, which gets data from the IoT device through API Gateway. It checks if the `deviceId` was provided and if the body contains valid JSON. If so, it timestamps the data and writes it to DynamoDB:

```tsx
import { APIGatewayEvent, APIGatewayProxyEventV2 } from "aws-lambda";
import {
    tableName,
    EZStoreDynamoItemMetric,
    getDateForSortKey,
    docClient,
    createAPIReturnObject
} from "../common";

export async function handle(event: APIGatewayProxyEventV2) {
    const deviceId = event.pathParameters?.deviceId;
    const body = event.body;

    if(deviceId === undefined || body === undefined){
        return createAPIReturnObject(400, "No deviceId or body");
    }

    // Decode the JSON body    
    let bodyJson: object;
    try{
        bodyJson = JSON.parse(body);
    }catch(e){
        return createAPIReturnObject(400, "No valid JSON provided");
    }

    // Write it to DynamoDB
    const sortKey = getDateForSortKey(new Date());
    const dataEntry: EZStoreDynamoItemMetric = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        ...bodyJson
    };

    await docClient.update({
        TableName: tableName,
        Key: {
            pk: deviceId,
            sk: sortKey,
        },
        UpdateExpression: "SET #data = list_append(if_not_exists(#data, :empty_list), :data_entry)",
        ExpressionAttributeNames: {
            '#data': 'data',
        },
        ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":empty_list": [],
            ":data_entry": [dataEntry],
        },
    });

    return createAPIReturnObject(200, JSON.stringify({
        success: true,
    }));
};
```

## Lambda #2: API
The second Lambda function exposes the stored data as a simple REST API. It makes sure that the `deviceId` is provided and extracts the start and end date from the query string parameters. If they're not available, it uses a default date range of 7 days.

It then queries the DynamoDB table and returns all the data as a flattened array:

```tsx
import { 
    APIGatewayEvent, 
    APIGatewayProxyResult 
} from "aws-lambda";

import { 
    getDateForSortKey, 
    tableName,
    docClient,
    createAPIReturnObject,
} from "../common";

export async function handle(event: APIGatewayEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> {
    const deviceId = event.pathParameters?.deviceId;
    if(!deviceId){
        return createAPIReturnObject(400, "No deviceId provided.");
    }

    // Parse the given start_date and end_date or use default values
    //      - start_date -> 7 days ago
    //      - end_date -> now
    const startDate = parseDateOrDefault(
        event.queryStringParameters?.start_date,
        new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
    );
    const endDate = parseDateOrDefault(
        event.queryStringParameters?.end_date,
        new Date(),
    );

    // Check if startDate is before the endDate. Otherwise DynamoDB will 
    // throw an error.
    if(startDate > endDate){
        return createAPIReturnObject(400, "Start date is after end date");
    }

    // Fetch from DynamoDB
    try{
        const data = await docClient.query({
            TableName: tableName,
            KeyConditionExpression: 'pk = :pk and sk BETWEEN :start AND :end',
            ExpressionAttributeValues: {
                ':pk': deviceId,
                ':start': getDateForSortKey(startDate),
                ':end': getDateForSortKey(endDate),
            },
        });

        // Flatten all messages into a single array
        const out = data.Items?.map(i => i.data).flat();
        return createAPIReturnObject(200, JSON.stringify({
            data: out,
        }));
    }catch(e){
        console.error("Error executing DynamoDB query", e);
        return createAPIReturnObject(500, "Database error");
    }
}

/**
 * Tries to parse the given input string to a Date object. If it fails,
 * it returns the provided defaultValue.
 * Note: this could return 
 */
function parseDateOrDefault(input: string|undefined, defaultValue: Date): Date{
    // Input must be defined and its format must make some sense
    if(!input || /\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/.test(input) === false){
        return defaultValue;
    }

    const tryParse = new Date(input);
    if(tryParse === undefined){
        return defaultValue;
    }

    return tryParse;
}
```

## Limitations of EZStore
While EZStore is very simple, it has some limitations:

* All data of a device for a day is grouped into a single item and that item can only be 400KB.
  * This is a limitation of DynamoDB which can be overcome by adding a suffix to the sort key like so: `reading-2022-01-04-1` `reading-2022-01-04-2`.
  * This limitation could also be overcome by adding compression. The JSON data coming from IoT devices is highly repetitive and compresses well.
  * Another solution is to group data completely differently. For instance: create 1 item for every hour of the day. The sort key would like this: `reading-YYYY-MM-DD-HH`

* At the moment, EZStore requires IoT device to `POST` data via HTTP. However, you could easily add a Lambda function that ingests data from other sources such as [AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/) (MQTT) or even specialized IoT networks like [Sigfox](https://www.sigfox.com/en).

Remember: EZStore is not meant as a general purpose IoT data store. It's a very na√Øve data store that focuses on low-volume IoT data for personal projects and prototypes.
