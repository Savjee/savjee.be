I spend most of my time building things in the digital world. Code, apps, content—you name it. But several years ago, I had an opportunity to build something physical. Something I could touch, something that would live in my home.

A shelf. Originally for books.

Here's how I, a digital-native, built my first piece of furniture—and how it evolved into something much more personal.

## Why build it myself?

I had a weird nook in my home office that was begging to be filled. The dimensions were awkward: 150cm wide, but only 83-100cm high (with a poster at 126cm that I didn't want to block). Depth was tricky too—I only had 30cm to work with, but the current closet was 50cm deep.

At the time, I thought: "I need a place for my books." My collection wasn't massive yet, but I wanted something that could grow with me.

Off-the-shelf shelves didn't fit. Custom-built? Too expensive. So I did what any reasonable person would do: I decided to build it myself.

I found inspiration on YouTube—there's something deeply satisfying about watching someone craft something with their hands. The design seemed simple enough: wooden boards, some screws, and a bit of patience.

## Digital tools for a physical build

Here's the thing: I'm not a carpenter. I don't have years of woodworking experience. But I do have Figma.

I started by drawing the shelf in Figma. Not because I needed high-end design work, but because I wanted to get the proportions right. How tall should each shelf be? How much space would I lose to the frame? Would it look weird if the middle shelves were different heights than the outer ones?

Figma let me play with dimensions and see the ratios instantly. I could drag elements around, resize them, and get a feel for how everything would fit together before I even bought a single piece of wood.

Then came the math. How many books would fit? I turned to ChatGPT for some quick estimates. Here's what we settled on:

- **Average book width:** 2.5cm
- **Average book height:** 23cm (larger hardcovers up to 26cm)
- **Usable shelf width:** 144cm (150cm minus 3 supports of 1.8cm each)
- **Books per shelf:** 57 books
- **Total capacity:** 171 books (3 inner shelves)

That's a lot of reading material—or so I thought at the time.

## Would the shelves sag?

Here's where my digital brain started worrying. I was planning to use 18mm thick wood panels. Would they sag under the weight of ~171 books?

Enter the Sagulator. Yes, that's a real tool—[The Sagulator](https://woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/) helps you calculate how much a shelf will deflect based on material, load, and dimensions.

> The Sagulator helps you design shelves by calculating shelf sag (deflection) given type of shelf material, shelf load, load distribution, dimensions, and method of attachment. You can also specify an edging strip to further stiffen the shelf.

Here's what I calculated:
- **Longest unsupported span:** 56cm
- **Books per shelf:** 19 books (at 3cm width each, to be conservative)
- **Weight per shelf:** ~7.6kg of books (rounded to 10kg for safety)
- **Wood thickness:** 18mm

The result? Using waferboard (the minimum stiffness rating), the shelf would sag just 0.01cm. That's "acceptable" according to the tool. Phew.

## Materials and cost

I decided to use two 240x60cm wooden panels. With some clever cutting, that's all I needed:

1. Cut each panel in half: 240x30cm
2. Cut for long boards: 150x30cm (2 pieces for the sides)
3. Leaves two pieces of 90x30cm
4. Cut each of those into 3, giving 6 pieces of 30x30cm (for the inner shelves)

Smart planning means minimal waste.

I went with a dark color (either charcoal or dark oak) to match my office aesthetic. Here's what I bought:

| Description | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Meubelpaneel 250x60 (2 stuks) | €83,98 |
| Black screws for gyproc (200 pieces) | €8,79 |
| Afplakband (5m, black) | €6,29 |
| Set of wood drills + accessories | €9,99 |
| **Total** | **€109,05** |

Not bad for a custom-built shelf that fits a weird nook perfectly.

## The building process

I'm not going to lie—I was nervous. I don't have a workshop. I don't have a table saw. I had a hand saw, a drill, and determination.

The cutting took longer than I expected. My hand saw skills are... adequate. The cuts weren't perfectly straight, but I knew the screws and the corner brackets would hide most imperfections.

Assembly was straightforward. I used corner brackets to connect the sides to the shelves, and the black screws blended in with the dark wood. The process taught me something important: you don't need fancy tools to build something functional.

It took me a few hours, but I had a bookshelf. A real, honest-to-goodness piece of furniture.

## From bookshelf to personal museum

Here's the thing: when I built this shelf, I had far fewer books than I do now. And while it *does* hold books, it's evolved into something much more personal.

What started as a simple bookshelf has become a collection of memories and passions:

**The F1 corner** — I'm a massive Formula 1 fan, so I've dedicated a section to my obsession. There's my F1 cap, some technical books about the sport, and my access card from the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps.

**A piece of computing history** — I'm a Mac guy, so I hunted down an original Macintosh Plus. And yes, it still works! I even got replica floppy disks to complete the experience. There's something special about booting up a machine from 1986.

**Professional milestones** — My colleagues gave me some meaningful gifts over the years: one set when I celebrated my 10-year anniversary with the company, and another when I eventually left. Both have found a home on my shelf.

**Family memories** — Father's Day gifts from my kids. Each one reminds me of a different stage of their childhood.

**Childhood nostalgia** — A Tintin rocket model and the LEGO Saturn V from Apollo 11. Some things never get old.

**Future reading** — Books for my children, carefully stored for when they're old enough to appreciate them.

## The shelf that grew too fast

Remember those calculations? 171 books of capacity? I thought that would last me years.

But here's the reality: I've already run out of space. The shelf that was meant to solve my book storage problem is now overflowing—and I haven't even reached half of that theoretical 171-book capacity.

Because I didn't just fill it with books. I filled it with pieces of myself. Every item tells a story. Every object represents a passion, a memory, or a moment in time.

And honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.

## The satisfaction of building

Here's what surprised me most: how incredibly satisfying it was to build something with my hands.

I'm used to the dopamine hit of shipping code or publishing a video. But physical building hits different. When I stepped back and looked at what I'd made—a shelf that could hold books, that was stable, that I could touch—there was a deeper sense of accomplishment.

It doesn't have to be perfect. If you look closely, there are small blemishes. The cuts aren't factory-straight. The wood grain doesn't perfectly align. But it's *mine*. I made it.

And that's worth more than buying something from IKEA that thousands of other people also have.

## What I learned

Building this shelf taught me a few things:

**You can design for your space.** Mass-produced furniture is made for average spaces. If you have a weird nook, an awkward corner, or specific dimensions you need to hit, DIY is your best friend.

**You don't need many tools.** Sure, a table saw would have made the cutting faster and more precise. But a hand saw, a drill, and some patience got the job done. Don't let "I don't have the right tools" stop you.

**The process is rewarding.** There's something visceral about sawing wood, feeling the screws bite into the material, and watching a pile of parts become a functional object. It's a different kind of creativity than I'm used to.

**Imperfections are okay.** In software, a bug is a bug. In physical building, small flaws are character. They tell a story. "Yeah, I made that."

**Plans change.** I built this as a bookshelf. It became a personal museum. And that's fine. The best projects are the ones that grow with you.

**You can never have enough space.** Trust me, you'll always find something else to fill it with.

## Would I do it again?

Absolutely.

In fact, I'm already eyeing other projects around the house. There's something deeply satisfying about building something that will last, that serves a purpose, and that exists in three dimensions rather than on a screen.

And who knows? Maybe I'll build another shelf soon. One for books. Because clearly, this one has other priorities.

If you've been thinking about building something yourself but feeling intimidated—go for it. Start small. Use your digital skills to plan and design, then embrace the messy, rewarding process of making something real.

Just don't blame me if you run out of space faster than you expected. It seems to be a recurring theme.
