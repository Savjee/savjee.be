I build digital things all day. Code, systems, videos, content.

A while ago I wanted to build something that exists outside a screen.

So I built a bookshelf.

At least… that was the original plan.

## The problem

There’s an awkward nook in my office:

- width: **150 cm**
- height: between **83 and 100 cm**
- depth available: about **30 cm**

Regular furniture didn’t fit. Custom furniture was expensive.
So I went for option three: build it myself.

## Planning it like a nerd

I’m not a carpenter, but I do know how to plan.

I sketched the shelf in Figma to get proportions right and avoid dumb mistakes before buying wood.

*Quick Figma sketch to test the layout.*

Then I estimated capacity:

- average book width: **2.5 cm**
- usable shelf width: **144 cm**
- about **57 books per shelf**
- around **171 books total** (on paper)

And yes, I checked sag too.

I used [The Sagulator](https://woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/) (best name ever) with conservative numbers:

- unsupported span: **56 cm**
- load: **~10 kg per shelf**
- material thickness: **18 mm**

Result: basically no meaningful sag.

## Materials and cost

I used two panels and cut everything from those.

| Description | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Meubelpaneel 250x60 (2 stuks) | €83,98 |
| Black screws for gyproc (200 pieces) | €8,79 |
| Afplakband (5m, black) | €6,29 |
| Set of wood drills + accessories | €9,99 |
| **Total** | **€109,05** |

For a custom shelf that actually fits the space: not bad.

## Build day

Tools were basic: hand saw, drill, patience.

No workshop, no fancy setup.

Cuts weren’t perfect, but assembly was straightforward and the end result was solid.

## It stopped being “just a bookshelf”

Over time it turned into a personal display wall:

- **F1 stuff** (including my Spa access card)
- an original **Macintosh Plus**
- gifts from colleagues
- gifts from my kids
- a few nostalgic pieces (Tintin rocket, LEGO Saturn V)
- and yes, books too

*What it looks like now: less “library”, more “life in objects”.*

## The funny part

I designed it for books and calculated capacity like a spreadsheet goblin.

And I still ran out of space.

Not because the math was wrong, but because the shelf became a place for memories as much as books.

## Why this was worth it

Building something physical gives a different kind of satisfaction than shipping software.

It’s imperfect, but it’s mine.

You can spot small flaws if you look closely. I like that. It proves someone actually made it.

*Not factory-perfect. Exactly the point.*

## What I learned

- If your space is weird, DIY often beats store-bought.
- You can do a lot with very simple tools.
- Planning upfront saves pain.
- Small imperfections are fine.
- Shelves fill up faster than expected. Always.

*Built for books, then claimed by everything else too.*

## Would I do it again?

Absolutely.

I already have a shortlist of next projects.

And if I build another shelf, I’m not pretending it’ll be only for books this time.

*One shelf. Many stories.*
