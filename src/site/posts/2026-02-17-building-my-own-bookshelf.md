I spend most of my time building things that live on screens.

This time I wanted to build something I could actually touch.

So I made a bookshelf for a weird little nook in my office.

It started as a practical project.
It ended up becoming something way more personal.

## The problem: a space that nothing fits

The nook looked simple, but it wasn’t:

- **150 cm** wide
- height between **83 and 100 cm**
- only about **30 cm** depth available

Anything off-the-shelf was either too deep, too tall, or both. Custom furniture would work, but the price didn’t make sense.

So I did what every overconfident software guy does at least once: “I’ll build it myself.”

## Planning a woodworking project like a software project

I’m not a trained carpenter, so I leaned on what I know: planning.

I mocked up the shelf in Figma first. Nothing fancy, just enough to check proportions and avoid obvious mistakes.

Then I did the classic nerd move: capacity math.

- average book width: **2.5 cm**
- usable shelf width: **144 cm**
- around **57 books per shelf**
- roughly **171 books total**

In theory, this shelf should have lasted a while.

## “Will it sag?”

That question lived in my head for days.

I used [The Sagulator](https://woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/) (still one of the best tool names on the internet) with conservative assumptions:

- unsupported span: **56 cm**
- load per shelf: **~10 kg**
- board thickness: **18 mm**

Outcome: negligible sag. Good enough for me.

## Materials + cost

I built it from two large wooden panels and cut all parts from those.

| Description | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Meubelpaneel 250x60 (2 stuks) | €83,98 |
| Black screws for gyproc (200 pieces) | €8,79 |
| Afplakband (5m, black) | €6,29 |
| Set of wood drills + accessories | €9,99 |
| **Total** | **€109,05** |

For custom furniture that fits perfectly: I’ll take that.

## Build day (with very non-professional tools)

No workshop. No table saw. No laser-guided anything.

Just a hand saw, a drill, and patience.

The cuts were not machine-perfect, but assembly went smoothly and the structure came out solid.

*Built, assembled, and finally in place.*

## It stopped being “just a bookshelf”

At first it was meant for books.

Then it slowly became a display of things that matter to me:

- Formula 1 items (including my Spa access card)
- an old Macintosh Plus
- gifts from colleagues
- gifts from my kids
- nostalgic pieces like Tintin and LEGO Saturn V
- and yes, still books

## The ironic part

I did all the calculations. I planned for capacity.

And I still ran out of space faster than expected.

Not because the design failed — because the shelf turned into a memory wall as much as a bookshelf.

## Why this project hit differently

Shipping software is satisfying.

But stepping back and looking at something physical you built yourself? Different feeling.

It’s imperfect. You can spot little flaws. A cut here, a tiny misalignment there.

I love that.

It doesn’t look mass-produced. It looks made.

*Not flawless. Still one of my favorite things in the room.*

## What I learned

- Weird spaces are often better solved with DIY.
- You can get far with basic tools if you plan well.
- Upfront thinking saves real pain later.
- Minor imperfections are part of the charm.
- Shelf space disappears faster than you think.

*Originally built for books. Now it carries a lot more than that.*

## Would I do it again?

Without hesitation.

I already have a shortlist of next projects.

And if I build another shelf, I’m not pretending it’ll be only for books this time.
