The human brain, with its 100 billion neurons, operates on just 20 watts of power. That's less than most light bulbs!

Compared to AI models like ChatGPT, the brain is 17,000 times more energy-efficient!

Training ChatGPT, required the same amount of energy that 40,000 US homes consume in a day. And that's just for training, not even running it!

With this vast power difference, you'd think ChatGPT runs circles around humans, but no. The human brain still outperforms AI in various tasks.

So, next time you flip on a light switch, remember: your brain is doing millions of calculations using less power than that light bulb.
