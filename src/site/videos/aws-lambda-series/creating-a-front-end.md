In this video I'll show you how to create a front-end for your Lambda functions. I'm going to build a HTML front-end for the guestbook functions that I showed you in the previous 2 video's.

The static front-end that I create in this video is written in HTML and Javascript and can be hosted anywhere you'd like. I've chosen to host it on Amazon S3 for scalability reasons.

# Source code
Source code of the front-end that I create in this video can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SavjeeTutorials/getting-started-with-lambda/tree/master/09-creating-a-front-end" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
