This is an introduction video to my "Learning TypeScript" series. In the next videos I will show you how to start using TypeScript. I'll discuss the benefits of TypeScript and how to use it step by step.

TypeScript compiles to regular JavaScript so it can run in any browser or on node.js. There's no reason not to use it!
