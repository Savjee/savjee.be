Use Graph Theory to transport a wolfüê∫ , sheep üêë and cabbage ü•ó across a river. Or use it to figure out how you can cross the 7 bridges of Konigsberg without crossing the same bridge twice. Or how about figuring out how to get from point A to point B?

Graph Theory is a field in mathemetatics that studies graphs. It can be applied to many problems and was invented in the 1736 by Leonhard Euler.
