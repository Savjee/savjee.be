We have no privacy on the web anymore. Our data is stored with many third-parties, some even sell it behind our backs. Solid aims to put all our data in a single place that's under our control (pods). Changing the way we deal with personal data.

Solid was started by the inventor of the web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. I can't wait to see the next generation of apps and services being built on Solid.


Special thanks to Ruben Verborgh for providing feedback on my script.
