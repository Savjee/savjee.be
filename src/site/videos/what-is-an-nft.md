NFT's are an innovation in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space that allows you to track who owns a particular item. Something tricky with digital files because they can easily be copied.  

NFT's are essentially smart contracts that live on blockchains like Ethereum, Flow, or Tezos. They can also be programmed to give the creator a royalty of every sale of his NFT.
