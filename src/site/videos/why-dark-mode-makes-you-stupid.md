Dark mode is popular, but can have a negative impact on your productivity. When using dark mode, you'll read slower and spot fewer errors.

This video was inspired by someone calling me a freak for using a light color theme while coding. In the end, I think it’s all about preference. I enjoy using light mode during the day and dark mode at night. But then again, bugs are attracted to light, so maybe I should only use dark mode when coding...

Anyway, don't think this personal if you prefer dark mode all the time.
