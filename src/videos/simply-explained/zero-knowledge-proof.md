Protecting your online privacy could become a lot easier with Zero Knowledge Proof. A technique that allows you to prove things without disclosing what it is you're proving.

Need to have a certain age before you can signup for a service? You can deliver a proof that you meet the criteria without sharing your actual age. Or you could prove to your bank that your salary is sufficient to get a loan, without revealing your real salary.
